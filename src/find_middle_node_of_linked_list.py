# question at Find the middle node of a singly linked list: https://gist.github.com/seanchen1991/3887a0315ca24fe4459bd704fcc60978


# working with singly linked lists here 

def find_middle_node_of_linked_list(ll):

    # idea 1:

    # get the length of the linked list 

    # how do we get the length? 

    # traverse the linked list and keep a counter to 

    # count how many jumps we make until we reach the end 

    # once we know the length, we can calculate the midpoint 

    # of that length 

    # use the midpoint formula from binary search 

    # start from the head of the linked list, jump until we

    # reach the midpoint node 

​

    # idea 2:

    # use two pointers that we'll start at the head of the list

    # the two pointers will run at different speeds:

    # one pointer will run at twice the speed of the other

    fast = ll

    slow = ll 

    # how do we have a pointer run at twice the speed of another? 

    # how do we update the pointers as we're traversing? 

    # if we iterate our slower pointer just as we would a "normal"

    # pointer while traversing a linked list 

    

    # while fast has not reached the end of the list yet 

    # how do we define "the end of the list"? 

    # fast is either on the None or fast is on the tail node 

    while fast and fast.next: 

        fast = fast.next.next 

        slow = slow.next

​

    # set fast = fast.next.next

    # once the faster pointer reaches the end of the list,

    # where will the slower pointer be? 

    # the slower pointer will be at the middle node 

    # return the node the slower pointer is pointing at 

    return slow
